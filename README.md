A Flutter-based mobile application designed to connect blood donors with recipients. The app uses **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data storage and retrieval, and **Firebase Authentication** for user management.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles using Firebase Authentication.
- **Donor Registration**: Users can register as blood donors by providing their details (e.g., blood group, location).
- **Blood Request**: Recipients can request blood by specifying their requirements (e.g., blood group, urgency).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Firebase Firestore ensures real-time updates for blood requests and donor availability.
- **Search Donors**: Users can search for donors based on blood group and location.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for new blood requests or donor matches.

---

## Firebase Collections

The app uses the following Firestore collections:

1. **`users`**:
   - Stores user profile information (e.g., name, email, blood group, location).
   - Example document structure:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
       "bloodGroup": "O+",
       "location": "New York",
       "isDonor": true
     }
     ```

2. **`donations`**:
   - Stores blood donation requests made by recipients.
   - Example document structure:
     ```json
     {
       "recipientId": "abc123",
       "bloodGroup": "A+",
       "location": "Los Angeles",
       "urgency": "High",
       "timestamp": "2023-10-15T12:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

3. **`notifications`**:
   - Stores notifications for users (e.g., new blood requests, donor matches).
   - Example document structure:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "xyz456",
       "message": "A new blood request matches your blood group.",
       "timestamp": "2023-10-15T12:30:00Z",
       "read": false
     }
     ```
